# MECH201
 ## Engineering Analysis

The objective of this repository is to teach the construction of mathematical models and the application of various numerical methods, linear algebra, Eigen value analysis, optimisation curve fitting, roots of equation, ordinary and partial differential equations to linear and non-linear engineering systems for the conservation of mass, momentum and energy in engineering systems, or for the analysis of fluid mechanics, heat transfer, solids mechanics, bulk solids, and control systems.

## How to use the scripts in the [**MECH201 repository**](https://github.com/AzdiarGazder/MECH201)
Visitors to this webpage may download and implement the entire library or individual scripts related to specific tools. Please report any issues with the scripts or webpage to the author directly via email (for a valid email address, please replace the word "dots" with periods).

The recommended method, which helps keep all MECH201 scripts up-to-date, is as follows: 
1. Download and install the [**GitHub Desktop**](https://desktop.github.com/).
2. Within the GitHub Desktop, click on **Files -> Clone a repository -> URL**.
3. In the **"Repository URL or GitHub username and repository"** dialog, type in "https://github.com/AzdiarGazder/MECH201" (without quotes).
4. In the **"Local path"** dialog, specify a local subfolder within your Matlab work path (usually "C:\Users\userName\Documents\MATLAB\GitHub" (without quotes)).
5. Click **"Clone"**. All files in this repository will then be available within the local subfolder "C:\Users\userName\Documents\MATLAB\GitHub\MECH201".
6. Add the local subfolder in pt. 5 (and its subfolders) to your Matlab work path. 
7. Restart Matlab. All functions in the MECH201 repository will now be available for use.
8. Remember to return to the GitHub Desktop on a weekly basis and click on **"Fetch origin"** to pull (update) the latest lecture and/or any edits/changes from the repository to your local subfolder.
