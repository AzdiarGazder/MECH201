 ## Engineering Analysis

The objective of this repository is to teach the construction of mathematical models and the application of various numerical methods, linear algebra, Eigen value analysis, optimisation curve fitting, roots of equation, ordinary and partial differential equations to linear and non-linear engineering systems for the conservation of mass, momentum and energy in engineering systems, or for the analysis of fluid mechanics, heat transfer, solids mechanics, bulk solids, and control systems.
